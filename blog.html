                  <h2>Art & Culture in Costa Rica</h2>
                  <h5>Dec 3 2019</h5>
                  <embed type="image/png" src="friends.png" width="300" height="200">
                  <p>I studied abroad in Costa Rica studying Spanish and the culture and civilization of Costa Rica.  Let me tell ya, it was the most memorable experience of my life, i have never been happier. If you ever get a chance to study abroad, take it! Honestly, it felt like stepping into an Instagram filter—everything was so vibrant! But beyond the beaches, rainforests, and "pura vida" vibes, I stumbled upon something magical: Costa Rica’s art scene. Spoiler alert: it's everywhere—and it’s awesome.</p>
                 <p>Let’s start with where we lived, San José, with a local family (Shout out to my amazing mamatica, I miss you). The streets here basically double as open-air galleries. Picture this: you're just walking along, sipping your iced coffee, and you’re hit with a mural bursting with colors, bold faces, and wild, swirling patterns. The street art here isn’t just about looking cool; it’s packed with messages about everything from social justice to environmental love letters. Each wall has a story to tell.</p>
                 <p>There’s something about being surrounded by nature that just flips a switch in your brain. In Costa Rica, that feeling is on a whole different level. I don’t know if it’s the sheer vibrancy of the place—the lush green jungles, the endless coastlines, or the crazy wildlife—but being here made me feel more connected to my creative side than ever before. One of the things I quickly learned is that Costa Rica doesn’t just offer views—it immerses you in them. You can't help but feel the urge to create when you’re standing in front of an active volcano like Arenal, with its imposing yet oddly beautiful presence. The smoke curling up into the sky, the sharp contrast of the dark rocks against the verdant green—it’s like nature hands you a paintbrush and says, “Go on, do something with this!”</p>
                 <p>Then there’s the rainforest. Walking through it, you’re hit with an explosion of colors, textures, and sounds. Leaves larger than umbrellas, vines twisting in every direction, and a chorus of birds, frogs, and insects making music in the background—it’s pure inspiration. It all feels like nature’s art, waiting to be interpreted.</p>
                 <p>What I love most is that Costa Rica encourages you to slow down and actually see nature, not just look at it. I started noticing the tiny details—the way the light dances off a leaf after a rainstorm or how a butterfly’s wings reflect the colors of the flowers it lands on. It’s these little moments of beauty that spark new ideas and make you want to capture them in your art.</p>
                 <p>For anyone seeking creative inspiration, there’s something about being in Costa Rica that just opens up your mind. The landscapes are living works of art, the wildlife is full of personality, and the entire environment feels like it’s cheering you on to create something uniquely yours.</p>
                 <p>Honorable mention: Lets not forget about ancient art. We took a visit to the National Museum of Costa Rica and were blown away by the pre-Columbian artifacts, pottery, and stone sculptures. These pieces are hundreds of years old and still jaw-dropping. There’s something incredible about seeing how art has always been a part of this country, from ancient times to now.</p>

          <h2>Rome: Living Beautifully</h2>
          <h5>April 1 2016</h5>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p>In Rome, art is inescapable, making it one of the most artistic cities in the world. You don’t even have to enter a museum to find yourself surrounded by incredible works of art. Just strolling down the street can lead you to stumble upon an ancient statue, a breathtaking fountain, or a lovely fresco that’s simply there for all to see. The whole city functions as an expansive gallery.</p>
    <p>From the instant I set foot in Rome, it felt as though I had traveled back in time, infused with a creative spirit that is truly ageless. The history here isn’t confined to display cases; it surrounds you at every turn. Take a step around a corner, and you’ll encounter a decaying column from a Roman temple. Glance upwards, and you’ll notice elaborate carvings on an ancient church. The buildings themselves seem to have been designed by skilled artisans.</p>
    <p>Let’s begin with the renowned landmarks: the Vatican Museums, the Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter’s Basilica. These sites represent the pinnacle of any art enthusiast’s must-visit list. Experiencing Michelangelo’s “Creation of Adam” in the Sistine Chapel is nothing short of extraordinary. The ceiling’s intricate details and vibrant colors can feel overwhelming, but in the most delightful way. You find yourself gazing upward, pondering how a single person could craft something so flawless.</p>
    <p>But even beyond the famous masterpieces, Rome is filled with hidden gems. I remember stumbling into tiny churches that looked plain on the outside, only to find jaw-dropping frescoes and paintings inside. One of my favorites was the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi, where you can see three of Caravaggio’s works up close. His use of light and shadow is so dramatic, it’s like his paintings are alive. You can feel the emotion and intensity coming off the canvas, which is wild considering they’ve been hanging there for hundreds of years.</p>
    <p>And of course, I can’t talk about Rome without mentioning the sculptures. The city is a playground for anyone who loves marble, and boy, do the Romans love marble. From Bernini’s “Apollo and Daphne” in the Borghese Gallery to the “Pietà” by Michelangelo, these sculptures are the definition of perfection. Bernini, especially, blew my mind with how he could turn cold, hard stone into something that looks soft and alive. You can see the muscles tense, the skin ripple, and the emotions play out on their faces. He captured a moment in time and froze it in marble.</p>
    <p>But here’s the thing I love most about Rome or Italy in general: art is woven into daily life. You’re not just seeing it in museums or churches—it’s in the piazzas, in the fountains, on the facades of buildings. The Trevi Fountain is a perfect example. It’s more than just a fountain; it’s this massive, dynamic work of art where the figures seem to emerge from the water. You toss in a coin, make a wish, and suddenly, you’re part of this centuries-old tradition. It’s magical.</p>
    <p>Even the food is a kind of art in Rome. When you’re sitting at a little café, sipping an espresso and nibbling on a slice of pizza, you can feel the creativity all around you. The way the Italians present their food—simple, yet with such care—reminded me that art isn’t just about paintings or sculptures; it’s about living beautifully.</p>
